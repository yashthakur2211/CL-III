## Prac1 - RPC Distributed Application
**Objective:**  
Design a distributed application using RPC (Remote Procedure Call) for remote computation where a client submits an integer value to the server, and the server calculates the factorial and returns the result to the client program.

---

## Prac4 - Fuzzy Set Operations
**Objective:**  
Implement Union, Intersection, Complement, and Difference operations on fuzzy sets.  
Also, create fuzzy relations by the Cartesian product of any two fuzzy sets and perform max-min composition on any two fuzzy relations.

---

## Prac5 - Load Balancing Simulation
**Objective:**  
Write code to simulate requests coming from clients and distribute them among servers using different load balancing algorithms (e.g., Round Robin, Least Connections, Random).

---

## Prac6 - GA-NN Hybrid Optimization
**Objective:**  
Optimize genetic algorithm parameters in a hybrid Genetic Algorithm-Neural Network modeling.  
Application: Spray drying of coconut milk.

---

## Prac7 - Clonal Selection Algorithm
**Objective:**  
Implement the Clonal Selection Algorithm using Python to solve optimization or classification problems.

---

## Prac8 - Neural Style Transfer
**Objective:**  
Create an artistic image by applying Neural Style Transfer using Deep Learning techniques, combining a content image and a style image.
